# FAQ#

Q. **I installed mod on my server, but all items are still the Vanilla Version?**

A. _If you installed mod on a NEW World. Close Space Engineers > Unsubscribe to mod > Resubscribe and let SE update mod > Open SE. 
If you installed on a pre-existing world, you must create Container/Battery/Solarpanel or Wind Turbine and replace the old ones._
