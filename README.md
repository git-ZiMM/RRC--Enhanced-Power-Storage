Q. I installed mod on my server, but all items are still the Vanilla Version?

A. If you installed mod on a NEW World. Close Space Engineers > Unsubscribe to mod > Resuscribe and let SE update mod then open. If you installed on a pre-existing world, you must create Container/Battery/Solarpanel or Wind Turbine and replace the old ones.
