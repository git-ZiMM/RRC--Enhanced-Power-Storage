Q. **I installed mod on my server, but all items are still the Vanilla Version?**

A. _If you installed mod on a NEW World. Close Space Engineers > Unsubscribe to mod > Resubscribe and let SE update mod > Open SE. 
If you installed on a pre-existing world, you must create Container/Battery/Solarpanel or Wind Turbine and replace the old ones._

*** If you have any issues and I haven't responded in comment section, I won't lie I'm horrible about checking comments, and may be easier to DM me on Discord usr_zimm or check FAQ [here](https://github.com/git-ZiMM/RRC--Enhanced-Power-Storage#readme)

**** With added weight to Containers, I added an Adjustable Thrust Multiplier Script to help with Ship weight if storage is full. Thank You Meridius_IX / Lucas!!! PLEASE CREDIT THE ORIGINAL AUTHOR FOR [THIS](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1660726401)
